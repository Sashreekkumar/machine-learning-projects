## Project 1: Regression

This project implements and compares multiple regression techniques using a unified workflow.

### Models implemented
1. Linear Regression  
2. Ridge Regression  
3. Lasso Regression  
4. Elastic Net  
5. Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor (SGDRegressor)  
6. Polynomial Regression  

### Tech stack
`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Data preprocessing
- Categorical features converted using one-hot encoding  
- Feature scaling performed using `StandardScaler`

### Evaluation metrics
- R² Score  
- Adjusted R²  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  

### Hyperparameter tuning
- GridSearchCV used to tune and compare all applicable models
